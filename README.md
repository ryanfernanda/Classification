# Classification

## Overview

Welcome to the "Classification" repository! This repository contains various machine learning classification analyses. It showcases different algorithms applied to classification problems, including but not limited to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.

## Code Examples

### Loading and Preprocessing Data

The code examples in this repository include data loading, preprocessing, and transformation steps such as feature scaling and encoding.

### Model Implementation

Each classification algorithm is implemented in its respective script or Jupyter notebook, demonstrating:

- **Training**: How to train the model on the dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Techniques like Grid Search for finding the best model parameters.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and visualizations to assess model performance.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ryanfernanda/Classification.git
     cd Classification
